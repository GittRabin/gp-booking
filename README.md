# GP Booking Application

This project is a demonstration of how to use Next.js, Prisma, and MySQL to build a GP booking application. The entire project was completed in 4 hours to teach a university student the fundamentals of these technologies.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
